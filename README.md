# Project Title
```Module 1:``` Excel Challenge

# Project Overview and Description
This project is associated with ```Module 1``` of **UofT's 2022-2023 Data Analytics Bootcamp**. Crowdfunding platforms like **Kickstarter** and **Indiegogo** have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, an increasing number of people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success. To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organizations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to find factors that may be able to translate to success. 

In this challenge, a database of 1,000+ sample projects was organized and analyzed to uncover any hidden trends. Moreover, the following deliverables were created:
- A ```pivot table``` that analyzed the initial worksheet and counted how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or were currently live **per Category**;
- A ```stacked-column pivot chart``` that can be filtered by **Country** based on the table that was created;
- A ```pivot table``` that analyzed the initial worksheet and counted how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or were currently live **per Sub-Category**;
- A ```stacked-column pivot chart``` that can be filtered by **Country** and **Parent Category** based on the table that was created;
- A ```pivot table``` that conatined a column of **Outcome**, rows of **Date Created Conversion**, values based on the **Count of Outcome**, and filters based on **Parent Category** and **Years**;
- A ```pivot-chart line graph``` that visualized the above table;
- A ```line chart``` that graphed the relationship between a goal amount and its chances of success, failure, or cancellation; 
- An Excel sheet of an analysis that contained the following statistics:

  - The ```mean``` number of backers;
  - The ```median``` number of backers;
  - The ```minimum``` number of backers;
  - The ```maximum``` number of backers;
  - The ```variance``` of the number of backers; and
  - The ```standard deviation``` of the number of backers; and
  
 - A Word document that contained a written summary and analysis of the results.
